## Check Out a short video walkthrough 


Description

---


A node.js application that uses user input from inquirer to populate a README.md file for user repository. The README.md file is created in the dist directory and can be found [here](./dist/README.md)
- At the end of the day, when starting a new project, I find that most of the time I want to just get going and not waste my time or brain power formatting/creating a README from scratch. I wanted it to be easier for myself and others to just get the ball rolling.
I created this so that I or anyone who finds this can quickly create a professional README for a new project with ease.
